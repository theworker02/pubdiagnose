## 1. Executive thesis

This project is **proprietary**. Production use, redistribution, and commercial deployment require a written commercial license or completed acquisition. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [ACQUISITION.md](./ACQUISITION.md). Contact [@theworker02](https://github.com/theworker02). <img src="assets/branding/logo-horizontal.svg" alt="PubDiagnose" width="420" /> <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/pubdiagnose"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pub/v/pubdiagnose.svg" alt="pub package" /></a>

**Why a buyer cares:** PubDiagnose packages transferable product IP â€” source, docs, in-repo brand assets, and a diligence room under `docs/acquisition/` â€” under a clear proprietary posture so diligence can proceed without mistaking the repo for open source.

## 3. Problem / opportunity

Teams evaluating PubDiagnose typically need either (a) a commercial right to run or embed it, or (b) outright ownership of the Product IP for strategic build-out. Public GitHub visibility without a proprietary license creates false assumptions about free production use. This brief and the linked data room make the commercial path explicit.

---

## 4. What ships today

Honest maturity: treat repository contents, README claims, tests, and release tags as the source of truth. Do not assume production customers, ARR, filed patents, or SLAs unless separately evidenced in diligence.

Typical transferable surfaces:

- Source tree and build/test scripts present in-repo
- Documentation and design notes
- Acquisition / diligence markdown under `docs/acquisition/`
- Branding assets committed to the repository (if any)

## 5. Demo / evaluation path (buyer)

Minimal path (no secrets required unless README says otherwise):

```
```bash
dart pub global activate pubdiagnose
```
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pubdiagnose: ^2.0.0-rc.2
```
```bash
pubdoctor check
```
```bash
cd your_project
dart pub get
pubdoctor check
pubdoctor why collection
pubdoctor outdated
```
```dart
import 'package:pubdiagnose/pubdiagnose.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final kernel = await PubDoctor.open('.');
  try {
    final result = await kernel.check();
    result.when(
      ok: (report) => print(report.status),
      fail: (f) => print(f.message),
    );
  } finally {
    await kernel.close();
  }
}
```
```bash
dart pub get
dart analyze
dart test
dart run scripts/verify.dart --skip-publish
```
```

Extended evaluation: `docs/acquisition/BUYER_EVALUATION.md`. Written NDA / evaluation grants may be required for private materials.

## 6. What a transaction typically includes

Subject to definitive schedules:

| Included (typical) | Excluded (typical) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Repo materials + asserted original IP | Seller personal accounts / unrelated repos |
| Docs + diligence room at closing | Third-party dependency source under separate licenses |
| In-repo brand marks as assigned | Secrets without rotation plan |
| Know-how captured in docs | Fabricated revenue, user, or adoption metrics |

---

## 7. Suggested deal structures

| Structure | When it fits |
|-----------|--------------|
| Non-exclusive commercial license | Deploy/run under seat or environment terms |
| Exclusive field-of-use license | Buyer wants exclusivity; seller may retain entity |
| Asset / IP assignment | Buyer wants ownership of Materials outright |
| OEM / redistribution | Separate agreement â€” not implied here |

Commercial terms (price, earnouts, escrow) are negotiated under NDA with counsel.

## 8. Buyer diligence checklist

- [ ] Confirm Rightsholder identity and authority to sell/license

- [ ] Run evaluation script (`BUYER_EVALUATION.md`)
- [ ] Review risks (`RISK_REGISTER.md`)
- [ ] Agree transfer scope (`TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md`) and handoff (`HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [ ] Supersede root `LICENSE` at closing via definitive agreement
